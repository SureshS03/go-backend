# GoConnect

A scalable backend service built with Go, implementing modern architectural patterns and industry best practices for high-performance distributed systems.

## Overview

GoConnect is a production-ready backend I built to deeply understand how to design and develop backend services from scratch using raw HTTP without any frameworks. Through this project, I gained strong skills in building scalable systems, implementing secure authentication, handling large user workloads, and applying DevOps best practices using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Go 1.24+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary data store)
- **Cache**: Valkey (Redis-compatible caching layer)
- **API Framework**: NaN

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Migration Management**: golang-migrate (having problems)


### Performance & Scalability
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient PostgreSQL schema design with proper indexing
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database and cache connections
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive service health monitoring


## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

1. **Build Stage**: Compiles Go binary and runs tests
2. **Docker Stage**: Builds and tags container images
3. **Kubernetes Stage**: Deploys to Minikube cluster
4. **Validation Stage**: Runs health checks and integration tests
5. **Migration Stage**: Applies database schema changes

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity monitoring
- Cache availability verification
- Service dependency health validation

### Metrics (Planned)
- Request latency and throughput
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Error rates and patterns

## Security

- Token-based authentication (using valkey)
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (planned)

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for database and cache
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Graceful degradation under load

## Deployment

### Local Development
Uses Docker Compose for easy local development with all dependencies.

### Production (Kubernetes)
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Persistent volume management
- Health probes and readiness checks
